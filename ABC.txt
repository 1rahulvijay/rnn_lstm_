To pull changes from a branch that is not the `master` branch and has one different commit, you can follow these steps:

1. **Checkout to Your Branch**: Make sure you are on the branch where you want to integrate the changes.
   
   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch
   ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes**: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Merge the Other Branch**: Merge the branch with the different commit into your current branch.

   ```bash
   git merge origin/branch-with-different-commit
   ```

   If there are no conflicts, this will integrate the commit from the other branch into your current branch. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually.

4. **Push Changes**: If you need to push the merged changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

Replace `your-branch` with the name of your current branch and `branch-with-different-commit` with the name of the branch you want to pull changes from.
