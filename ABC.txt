## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repository
```

## Classes

### GettingDataFromOracle

This class is responsible for connecting to an Oracle database and retrieving data. It includes methods for executing queries and handling the results.

#### Example Usage

```python
from getting_data_from_oracle import GettingDataFromOracle

db = GettingDataFromOracle(connection_string)
data = db.fetch_data("SELECT * FROM your_table")
```

### SendingMail

The `SendingMail` class handles sending emails through SMTP. You can configure the sender, recipient, subject, and body of the email.

#### Example Usage

```python
from sending_mail import SendingMail

mailer = SendingMail(smtp_server, port, login, password)
mailer.send_email(sender, recipient, subject, body)
```

### ReadingExcelFilesAndDirectories

This class provides functionality for reading Excel files and traversing directories. It can extract data from multiple Excel files within a directory.

#### Example Usage

```python
from reading_excel_files_and_directories import ReadingExcelFilesAndDirectories

reader = ReadingExcelFilesAndDirectories(directory_path)
excel_data = reader.read_excel_files()
```

### LoadingDataToOracle

The `LoadingDataToOracle` class is used to load data into an Oracle database. It supports batch insert operations and error handling.

#### Example Usage

```python
from loading_data_to_oracle import LoadingDataToOracle

loader = LoadingDataToOracle(connection_string)
loader.load_data(table_name, data)
```

## Dependencies
