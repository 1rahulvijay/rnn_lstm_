Subject: Update on Your Concerns

Dear [Stakeholder’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to address the concerns you raised regarding the discrepancies in the data.

	1.	The first concern you mentioned is related to the differences in the credit agreement ID and the lynx_fac_id. After reviewing the details, it appears that these differences are the root cause of the issues you encountered.
	2.	Regarding the second concern, it has been identified that the source system does not have the necessary data, resulting in the empty fields you observed.

We are currently working on these issues to ensure accuracy and will keep you updated on our progress. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional clarification.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]
[Your Company]

Feel free to modify any details to better fit your communication style!
